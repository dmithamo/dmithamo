##### :wave: Hi there, Mithamo here

- I build software for a living and for fun.
- I have been at it since 2018.

##### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Me at a Glance

- :construction_worker: I have previously worked:
  - as a web dev with an oil and gas importer/retailer, building internal tooling to make them more efficient and performant
  - as a web dev with a player in the IoT space, building cool dashboards that help manage telemetry data.
  - as a web dev with an outplacement agency, helping build an intuitive tool designed to streamline comms between financial coaches and their clients in the US.

- :computer: I am always on the look out for new opportunities, with a bias towards web dev oppportunities (fullstack web).
