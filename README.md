##### 👋 Hi there, Mithamo here

- I build software for a living and for fun.
- I have been at it since 2018.

##### ⏳ Me at a Glance

- 👷 I have previously worked:
  - as a web dev with a major player in the sports betting domain, helping build a real time dashboard for surfacing important business metrics
  - as a web dev with a software company, currently building a logistics platform deployed as a SaaS solution in the LPG industry
  - as a web dev with an oil and gas importer/retailer, building internal tooling to make them more efficient and performant
  - as a web dev with a player in the IoT space, building cool dashboards to help make sense of telemetry data
  - as a web dev with an outplacement agency, helping build an intuitive tool designed to streamline communication between financial coaches and their clients in the US.

- 🖱️ I am always on the look out for new opportunities, with a bias towards web dev oppportunities (fullstack web).
