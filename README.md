##### :wave: Hi there, Mithamo here

I build software for a living and for fun. If you corner me, I will admit that I do it more for the fun than for the living.

##### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Me at a Glance

- :construction_worker: I am currently working with a player in the IoT space as a web dev, building cool dashboards that help manage telemetry data.

- :books: I am learning _Go_ and _Angular_, looking to diversify my competencies as a software engineer.
