I build software for a living and for fun. If you corner me, I will admit that I do it more for the fun than for the living.

##### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Me at a Glance

- :construction_worker: I am currently working with a player in the IoT space as a web dev, building cool dashboards that help manage telemetry data.

- :books: I am learning _Go_ and _Angular_, looking to diversify my competencies as a web developer.

- :duck: I am looking to collaborate on a tool than utilises _Go_, especially one that heavily makes use of _Go's_ concurrency model. This to wrap me head around those `go routines` and `channels` _Go_'s known for.

> :point_right: Feel free to point me towards something like that. As long as it's beginner friendly-ish.
